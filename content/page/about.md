My name is [Antonio Rueda-Toicen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonioruedatoicen/). I moved in to Berlin in 2019 and started this group back then. I enjoy mentoring curious people. 

We have hosted live events in collaboration with:
*  [Berlin Linux Users Group](https://www.belug.de/home.html)
*  [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com/)
* [Withoutbg](https://withoutbg.com/)
*  [Google Student Developers Group at TU Berlin](https://gdsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-technische-universitat-berlin-presents-devfest-on-campus-at-technical-university-berlin/)
*  [Hasso Plattner's Institute AI Service Center](https://hpi.de/kisz/events-1.html)

If you'd like to give a talk with us or get help hosting an event, please get in touch.
